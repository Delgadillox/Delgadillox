Hello world! 👋🌍

I'm a passionate Applications Developer hailing from Mexico, specializing in crafting top-notch mobile, web, and software applications. My skill set encompasses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, C#, PHP, NodeJS, and I also have experience with Golang. I'm proficient in databases such as MySQL and SQLServer. The dynamic combo of React Js/React Native is my preferred toolkit for front-end wonders.
